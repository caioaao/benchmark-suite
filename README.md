# benchmark-suite

A **very** simple benchmark suite.

# TODO

- [ ] Discover and run benchmarks like a test runner
- [ ] Support benchmarks that don't need datasets
- [ ] Benchmark tests (comparing results to a baseline - goal is to protect projects from performance regressions)
- [ ] API to run only a subset of benchmarks
- [ ] kaocha runner?
- [ ] Option to run [quick-benchmark](http://hugoduncan.org/criterium/0.4/api/criterium.core.html#var-quick-benchmark) instead of the more rigorous [benchmark](http://hugoduncan.org/criterium/0.4/api/criterium.core.html#var-benchmark)
